 * The {@link ResumableTask} interface is the main interface for a
 * general purpose task. A task has a type which is used to match it against an
 * executor. The task is passed a {@link TaskExecutionEnvironment} with which
 * it can interact.
 * <p>
 * When a task executes, it can return any object as a result. A special
 * result is the {@link Yield} object which can be used to pause the execution
 * and store an intermediate state for a later resumption of execution.

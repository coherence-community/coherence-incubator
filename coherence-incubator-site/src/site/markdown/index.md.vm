<h4>Overview</h4>

The Oracle Coherence Incubator project consists of a collection of code examples,
organized as [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) modules, demonstrating advanced
uses of [Oracle Coherence](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/coherence/index.html)
and integration with third-party projects.

The modules themselves consist of a collection of common utilities, tools,
traditional software pattern implementations, third-party integrations, and
distributed computing solutions that of which may be used as-is, for research,
learning, extension or for direct inclusion into Coherence-based applications.
  
Complete source code together with documentation is provided to aid in adoption,
use and understanding.

<h4>Plug-Ins:</h4>

The following [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) modules provide Coherence-based
plug-ins and extensions to third-party products.

[**The JVisualVM Plug-In:**](jvisualvm/index.html)

Provides a [JVisualVM](http://visualvm.java.net/) Plug-In (ie: Dashboard) allowing
developers to view summarized statistics and information when connected to a JMX
enabled Coherence cluster.

<h4>Libraries:</h4>

The following [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) modules provide
Coherence-based patterns, packages and additional libraries for inclusion in
developer applications.

[**The Common Package:**](common/index.html)

Provides a collection of utility packages, classes and interfaces commonly 
used to support the implementation of other Oracle Coherence Incubator modules.

[**The Command Pattern:**](commandpattern/index.html)

Provides a distributed implementation of the classic Command Pattern.

[**The Functor Pattern:**](functorpattern/index.html)

Provides a distributed implementation of the classic Functor Pattern.

[**The Processing Pattern:**](processingpattern/index.html)

Provides an mechanism to perform distributed, grid computing with Coherence.

[**The Messaging Pattern:**](messagingpattern/index.html)

Provides a simple implementation of Store and Forward Messaging.

[**The Event Distribution:**](eventdistributionpattern/index.html)

Provides a mechanism to distribute application events over multiple channels. 
This is core infrastructure for the Push Replication Pattern, but may be used 
directly with in applications for local or global event distribution.

[**The Push Replication Pattern:**](pushreplicationpattern/index.html)

Provides a mechanism to replicate cache entry events to other clusters and 
devices (including other clusters separated by WANs).

<h4>Examples:</h4>

The following [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) modules provide
Coherence-based examples, typically for the patterns and libraries included
in the Coherence Incubator.

[**The Command Pattern Examples:**](commandpattern/simple-example.html)

Provides example uses of the Command Pattern.

[**The Functor Pattern Examples:**](functorpattern/simple-example.html)

Provides example uses of the Functor Pattern.

**The Processing Pattern Examples:**

The following examples are provided for the Processing Pattern:

1.  The [Simple Callable Example](processingpattern/simple-example.html)

2.  The [Pi Calculation Example](processingpattern/pi-calculation-example.html)

3.  The [Task Execution Example](processingpattern/task-execution-example.html)

**The Push Replication Pattern Examples:**

The following examples are provided for the Push Replication Pattern:

1.  The [Active Passive](pushreplicationpattern/active-passive-example.html) Topology

2.  The [Active Active](pushreplicationpattern/active-active-example.html) Topology

3.  The [Hub and Spoke](pushreplicationpattern/hub-and-spoke-example.html) Topology

4.  The [Auction Example](pushreplicationpattern/auction-example.html) (using an Active Active and Active Passive Topologies)

5.  The [Coherence*Web Example](pushreplicationpattern/web-example.html)

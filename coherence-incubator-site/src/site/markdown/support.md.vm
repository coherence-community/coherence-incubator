Getting Help
------------

There are many options to receive help, guidance and support when using the Coherence Incubator.
Here are but a few.

<h4>Community Forums</h4>

The Discussion Forums for the Coherence Incubator are the best place to start
asking questions - should you need to.   These forums are hosted by Oracle and
are typically monitored by the community.

The support forums are hosted here:
[https://community.oracle.com/community/fusion_middleware/coherence/the_coherence_incubator_forum][SUPPORT]

<h4>Source Code, Tests and Examples</h4>

As all of the source code, including tests and examples are now published, these
are often a great place to start for implementation tips.

The source code is located here:

<h4>Issue Tracking System</h4>

Defects and enhancement requests for the Coherence Community, including the Coherence Incubator
are managed, prioritised and tracked using the java.net issue tracking system.

If you find an issue with the Coherence Incubator or have an idea for a new feature
the best place to start is with the Issue Tracking System.  All issues, both current and
past are publicly viewable.

The Issue Tracking System can be found here: [http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC][ISSUES]

>   To raise new issues you will need a [java.net][JAVANET] account (these are free).

<h4>Oracle Support</h4>

Oracle Coherence customers may raise Service Requests (SR) through My Oracle Support for
Coherence Community projects, including the Coherence Incubator, against the Oracle Coherence
product.  If a Coherence Community project is confirmed to be a contributing factor for an
SR, Oracle will subsequently raise an issue (if one does not exist) on java.net for the
appropriate project for it to be resolved by Oracle and/or the Coherence Community.  Afterwards
a comment indicating as such will be made in the SR.

Should Oracle determine that the root cause of an SR is with Oracle Coherence itself, Oracle will
raise a defect for Oracle Coherence.  Should Oracle determine that the root cause of an SR is
a third-party product, Oracle will advise the customer to raise an issue with said product
manufacturer and after which will work with both to resolve the said issue.
